# Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

## Objective
To design and train a CNN that classifies images from the CIFAR-10 dataset into one of ten predefined categories, such as airplanes, cars, and animals.

## Introduction
Image classification is a fundamental task in computer vision. This project leverages CNNs to handle image data effectively. The CIFAR-10 dataset provides a diverse and balanced dataset for building a beginner-friendly image classification model.

## Dataset Details
- **Name:** CIFAR-10  
- **Description:** Contains 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes.  
- **Classes:** Airplane, Automobile, Bird, Cat, Deer, Dog, Frog, Horse, Ship, Truck.

## Tools and Technologies
- Python
- TensorFlow/Keras
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

## Project Workflow
1. Import libraries and load the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. Visualize sample images from the dataset.
3. Define the CNN architecture.
4. Compile and train the model.
5. Evaluate the model's performance.
6. Save and test the model with unseen data.

## Results
- **Training Accuracy:** 77% after 10 epochs.  
- **Test Accuracy:** 72.02%.  

## Challenges and Solutions
| **Challenge**                          | **Solution**                                                                 |

| Handling overfitting                   | Added Dropout layers to reduce overfitting.                                  |
| Limited training data variability      | Normalized images and used the diverse CIFAR-10 dataset.                     |
| Misclassifications in similar classes  | Increased CNN depth to extract finer features.                               |

## Extensions
- **Data Augmentation:** Use techniques like rotation and zoom to improve generalization.
- **Batch Normalization:** Add layers for faster convergence.
- **Transfer Learning:** Implement pretrained models like VGG16 or ResNet for better accuracy.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates CNNs' application for image classification, serving as a foundational step toward more complex tasks in computer vision.
